So, this is my contribution to the open source stuff that we have
been talking about all along this way. This seems so intriguing and
practical that I'm so actually engaged with all of this stuff
that I can't help but love it. So good, really!
Ok, so lets make another modification to use the command git add .
and then use git status.
